Writing your book is a monumental feat, congratulations! You’ve done the hard part. Now it’s time to make it alluring on the outside. 

As an avid reader, I know that a book cover can make a huge difference in my decision to pick up a book. A dull book cover can mean the loss of a reader, which is why that cover is so important. 

As an artist, I understand the journey you’ve been on; making everything right, asking the opinions of trusted friends and family, editing, iterating, scrapping and refining. I do the same. 

This will be a journey we go on together. You can tell me all about your book, the themes, important people and places, and give me a synopsis of the book. I am happy to read the whole thing to make sure it is perfect. I’ll work up some options, and together we can make a cover that reflects your story.

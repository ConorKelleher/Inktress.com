Your book cover is judged, despite the saying, so let’s make sure readers have a captivating design to grab their attention. I offer custom covers designed with your genre and story in mind. Each design is made to work both physically and digitally, so where ever it’s seen it still looks great. 

Whether you're an indie author or a publisher, I will work closely with you to create the perfect cover. I specialise in illustrative and typographic design. If you like what you see, get in touch! Let’s make something beautiful.

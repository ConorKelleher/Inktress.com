Trying to bring an idea to life? Character illustrations help solidify a project and make it feel real and tangible.

Character design is all about imbuing a personality into visuals, making someone look how they act. Each project has different needs, different audiences, this all needs to be considered when making a character. 

I will work with you to understand who your character is, what they represent, and who they are for. I will create some sketches and together we can make a design that matches your character.

Being a musician is so difficult right now, the last thing you need is to have to make your own album cover. Creating art of any kind takes dedication and an almost unhealthy obsession. As a fellow artist I am here to support you in creating a design that translates audio to visual. 

This will be a journey we go on together. You can tell me all about your music, the themes and ideas, and let me listen to it. Once I understand your music and audience Iâ€™ll work up some options, and together we can make a cover that reflects your album. 

The initial consultation is free, so why not get in touch?

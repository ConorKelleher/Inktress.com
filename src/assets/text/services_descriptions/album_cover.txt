Your album cover is an extension of your music. It should look as good as you sound. Your cover should resonate with your audience, help you sell merch, promote your music, and create a deep connection with your fans. 

Whether you're creating your debut album or you're an established musician I will work closely with you to make sure that the art merges together and feels right.

It will be designed to work physically and digitally, so it looks good wherever itâ€™s seen. If you like what you see, get in touch.

I’m Rosie or "Inkantress" as I go by online. I’m an illustrator and designer, starting my fascination with art from the tender age of four inspired by my mom. I now have a degree in Graphic Design from Waterford IT, and worked my way up from intern Graphic Designer to Art Director at Kargo Commerce in three years. These days I like to work with smaller clients, helping them make their businesses and projects a reality. Though if the project is right, I will gladly take on larger client projects to make something that really tickles my fancy. I try to keep things clear and simple for my clients, making the process easy and ensuring that the creation is perfectly suited to their project.

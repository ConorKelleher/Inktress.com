It began, like me, with my mother. She was an incredible artist, and she showed me how. Every moment of boredom was quickly taken up by a piece of paper and whatever drawing implement I could find. 

I don’t think I could stop now if I tried. I got my first paid creative job in 2020, and I’ve been creating professionally since then. I’ve worked with big corporations, and with indie projects alike. Helping them get their message, their idea, out there.
